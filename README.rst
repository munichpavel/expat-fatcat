expat-fatcat
============

expat-fatcat helps US taxpayers living abroad file their tax returns by giving you automated conversion of payments in a foreign currency into USD using an exchange rate valid on the day of your payment, as required for form f2555.

User story
----------

Alice is an American expat, and to fill out her US taxes each year, she has to convert income payments and relevant expenses (e.g. rent) into US dollars on the day that the payments were made using a valid exchange rate.

For each currency, Alice collects the different payment amounts and dates she needs to convert to USD, e.g. rent and salary in EUR, investment returns in GBP. A planned future stage in ```expat-fatcat``` is to offer it as a webservice, where for each currency, Alice would upload the relevant excel sheets containing payment amounts and dates.
