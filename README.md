# expat-fatcat

expat-fatcat helps US taxpayers living abroad file their tax returns by giving you automated conversion of payments in a foreign currency into USD using an exchange rate valid on the day of your payment, as required for form f2555.

See this [notebook](notebooks/example_usage.ipynb) for the main features of `expat_fatcat` on sample income and housing payment data.

## User story

Alice is an American expat, and to fill out her US taxes each year, she has to convert income payments and relevant expenses (e.g. rent) into US dollars on the day that the payments were made using a valid exchange rate.
